# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose comparison (==) and its unexpected behavior with null, undefined, and 0.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, showing how loose comparison can lead to incorrect results.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code using strict comparison (===).
